Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/fileformats.html).

Fully developed TF data sources can be found here:
[corpora](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/about/corpora.html)

Here you find a few data sources developed as a pilot project.

See the 
[docs](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric-data/).

In order to work with them, you need
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric/tf)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
