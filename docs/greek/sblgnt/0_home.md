# About

Greek New Testament Dataset, treebanks with full text, compiled by
Randall Tan, Jonathan Robie, and 
Andi Wu as part of the [biblicalhumanities group](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities). The source materials, documentation and licence conditions can be found
at the
[SBLGNT treebanks](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/tree/master/syntax-trees/sblgnt)
github repo.

## Conversion
The conversion of this dataset to
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
has been carried out by Cody Kingham and Dirk Roorda.
The source has been taken on 2017-01-03
(commit [1b4242c1ac6ae3012b751d00f735556710a0d21a](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/greek-new-testament/commit/1b4242c1ac6ae3012b751d00f735556710a0d21a))

The conversion has preserved all information present in the `<Node>`-elements of the treebanks.
All attributes have been faithfully translated to individual Text-Fabric features.
The attribute `Cat` has been used, together with the fact whether a `<Node>` appears as root or as leaf,
to determine an object type, such as *sentence*, *clause*, *phrase*, *word*.

The result has 137794 word nodes (*slots*), and 428430 nodes in total.

### 2017-03-21 
Added features [g_word](g_word), [g_plain](g_plain), [trailer](trailer). 
These have been computed from [Unicode](unicode).

## Extra information
We have added the names of the input files as book names and destilled the book, chapter, verse information
that is present in each `<node>` identifier into Text-Fabric node types `book`, `chapter`, `verse`, with
features that give their sequence numbers. 
Besides that, we have added book names in few dozen languages.
This information is obtained mainly from wikipedia.
A special thanks to Nathan Gibson, who has put, very conveniently, a list of bible books in Syriac on
the
[wikipedia entry for the peshitta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).

## Computed information
We have added some statistical features: frequencies and ranks of word occurrences and lexemes.

The input xml representation consists of 27 files with a collective size of 64 MB.

The converted Text-Fabric resource consists of 60 files with a collective size of 31 MB.
